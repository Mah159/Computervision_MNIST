The MNIST dataset, a widely used dataset in machine learning and computer vision for training and testing image classification models.

MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) is a dataset of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9), along with their corresponding labels. The dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Each image is a 28x28 pixel square, and each pixel's intensity is represented by a value between 0 and 255.

The code is related to image classification using a neural network (a convolutional neural network or CNN), and the MNIST dataset is being used for training and evaluating the model.
